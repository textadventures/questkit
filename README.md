QuestKit
========

QuestKit is no longer under development.

QuestKit was intended to pick up [Quest 5](https://github.com/textadventures/quest) and become a cross-platform, JavaScript toolkit for creating text adventure games with a parser. It was abandoned some years ago, and alex subsequently left quest altogether. More on the [Developer Forum](http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=15).

The principle of QestKit is being continued as [QuestJS](https://github.com/ThePix/QuestJS) (aka Quest 6), which is under active development (as of Mar 2020!), and may ultimately adopt the name QuestKit.
